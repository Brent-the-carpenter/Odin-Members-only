# Odin Members Only

This is my project submission for the Members Only project in The Odin Project Full stack javascript learning path. It allowed me to demostrate my understanding of user authentication and sessions to track wether a user is logged in or not and to give access to the user based on their communtiy standing. The project also allowed me to practice working with a database doing CRUD opetatrions on data using routes built into the application.
